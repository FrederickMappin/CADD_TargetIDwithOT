#Target Identification in CADD
Target identification is a critical first step in Computer-Aided Drug Design (CADD), where the goal is to determine the biological molecules—typically proteins—that play a key role in a disease process. By identifying and validating these targets, researchers can focus drug discovery efforts more effectively, increasing the chances of developing successful therapeutics.

#What OpenTargets Does
Open Targets is a collaborative platform that integrates data from genomics, transcriptomics, clinical studies, and other sources to help researchers systematically identify and prioritize potential drug targets. It provides a robust, data-driven framework to explore the association between targets and diseases, making it a valuable resource for early-stage drug discovery.
